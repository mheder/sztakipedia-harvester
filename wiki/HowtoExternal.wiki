#summary How to write and deploy your custom processor

== Introduction ==

Sztakipedia harvester has two main components.
 * a standalone IRC reader that listens on wikipedia channels and downloads the modified articles from the Wikipedia API and posts it (HTTP POST) to a configured server+port. 
 * An UIMA Consumer + Aggregate Analysis Engine. The Consumer listens on a HTTP port, waiting for the articles and the the Analysis Engine Processes the articles. However, with the Analysis Engine you have two options
   * Use Sztakipedia's AAE, that builds a Lucene index
   * Use the so-called "External Processor" Chain, in which the articles are pre-processed (links, sentences, categories, etc are recognized)and you provide your own java class that deals with the result - sends it somewhere or stores it your own way. 

This Page describes how to get your own External Processor solution running
